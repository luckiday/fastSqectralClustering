1. To run the program, type the following command in R

	>source("script.R")

2. Note:
o File "loader.R" contains R code to load the data. Proper modifications are
  required to pick up the right dataset. To add a new dataset, simply
  follow examples provided in the file.
o "kasp.R" contains the code for KASP (fast approximate spectral clustering
  implemented with K-means).
o All parameters are to be modified within file kasp.R. This includes the
  data reduction ratio "alpha", bandwidth for the Gaussian kernel "sigma".
  Additionally, one can also set the following parameters based on needs:

  	> maximum number of iterations "iter.max" in K-means
	> number of restarts "nstart" in K-means
	> sampling ratio (currently 0.1 is used for dataset smaller than 300000
	  and 0.05 otherwise) 
	> number of permutations to sample when computing clustering rate
	  (currently 10000 is used if the number of final clusters is larger
	  than 7)
